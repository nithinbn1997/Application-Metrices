##	QCL â€“ Qarbon Common Language

###	Introduction

Each Data Center has its own proprietary set of APIs and platforms (playground, sandbox and production) for interfacing which applies to all aspects of FCAPS. Not only do the APIs differ in functionality, they also have very different data fields with varying interpretations. This poses a challenge in terms of working with products from multiple data centers. No standard form of interfacing from ERP/CRM systems to Data Centers is available.

Qarbon has come up with a unique solution to solve this problem of connectivity to the Data Center for all Business Transactions related to FCAPS (Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security) as well as MEF (Metro Ethernet Forum) standards with a ERP/CRM system. QCL (Qarbon Common Language) is an API interface that can be integrated with the CRM System or the Data Center for seamless access to resource details. 

###	Salient Features
